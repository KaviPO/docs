### Key Points

<Info>
  * The Capture API completes the payment process by moving the authorized funds from the customer’s account to the merchant’s account.

  * This API is typically used after an authorisation when the final amount is confirmed, such as after goods are shipped or services are provided.

  * Only the amount that was previously authorised can be captured. If the capture is for a lesser amount, the remaining funds will be released.
