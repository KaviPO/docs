### Key Points

<Info>
  * The Void Authorization API is crucial when a decision is made not to proceed with a transaction that has been authorised but not yet captured.

  * Once the authorization is voided, the funds that were held on the customer’s account are released, making them available to the customer again.

  * This API is typically used in scenarios where an order is cancelled before fulfilment or if there’s a change in transaction details requiring re-authorisation.
