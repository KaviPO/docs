### Key Points

<Info>
  * The Authorization API secures the specified amount on the customer's payment method, but the funds are not transferred until a capture is performed.

  * **Capture**: Finalizes the transaction by transferring the authorized funds from the customerâ€™s account.

  * **Void**: Cancels the authorization, releasing the held funds back to the customer.

  * Use cases for this API include scenarios where the exact final amount may vary, such as hotel bookings, car rentals, or pre-order situations.
