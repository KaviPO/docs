### Key Points

<Info>
  * The Refund API allows the merchant to reverse a transaction, sending the funds back to the customerâ€™s payment method.

  * This API is typically used in scenarios such as order cancellations, product returns, or when a customer disputes a charge.

  * Refunds can be partial or full, depending on the amount specified in the refund request. If a partial amount is refunded, the remaining balance of the original transaction is still valid.
