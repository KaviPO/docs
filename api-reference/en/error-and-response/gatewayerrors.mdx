## **Understanding Entity Level and Product Level**

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="Entity Level" icon="map-location-dot">
    Entity-level rules apply to the merchant's operational region or country. These settings enforce restrictions and policies specific to geographical areas.  
    **Example**: Blocking transactions originating from certain card countries or IP addresses based on merchant location.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Product Level" icon="folder-gear">
    Product-level rules are specific to individual products or services within the gateway, like "Pay by Link" or "Subscription." These manage behaviors and restrictions tied to each product.  
    **Example**: Setting refund velocity limits or transaction thresholds for a specific product.

This distinction helps merchants and developers troubleshoot errors effectively and ensures that compliance and restrictions are properly managed across regions and products.
