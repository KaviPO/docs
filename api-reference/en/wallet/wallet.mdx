### Key Points

<Info>
  Merchant Configuration

  * The **Merchant ID** for GCash must be included in the payload along with the specific `payment_method` type set to `gcash`.

  * If the merchant is configured for GCash, the HPP will generate an E-Wallet payment link to enable customers to pay via GCash. [See all supported E-Wallets...](/documentation/paymentmethods/ewallets)

  E-Wallet Link

  * The HPP will display an option for customers to pay via GCash or generate an E-Wallet link for the customer to use.

  * This ensures a smooth process for customers using their GCash E-Wallet to complete transactions.
