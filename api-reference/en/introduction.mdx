Welcome to the **Payment Options Gateway API Documentation**. This API enables users to integrate payment processing capabilities into their applications, ensuring secure, reliable, and efficient handling of transactions. Designed using the RESTful architectural style, it provides flexibility, scalability, and simplicity in communication with Payment Options Gateway systems.
### **REST Architectural Style**

This API follows the [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST)ful architectural principles, Each request contains all the information needed to process it, ensuring scalability.

* **HTTP Methods**:

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="GET Method" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/GET">
    Retrieve data from the server
  </Card>
  <Card title="POST Method" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/POST">
    Create a resource on the server
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

* **Resource-Oriented URLs**: Ensures clear and structured request handling.

### **HTTP Response Codes**

[HTTP response codes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status) indicate the status of each request:

* **200–299**: Successful responses.

* **400–499**: Client error responses.

* **500–599**: Server error responses.

### **Base URL**

All API requests are encrypted and transmitted securely over HTTPS.

* **LIVE URL**: [https://api.paymentoptions.com](https://api.paymentoptions.com)

* **Secure Communication**: Ensures sensitive data remains protected.

### **Best Practices for API Integration**

Follow these guidelines to ensure a smooth integration experience:

* **HTTP Client Compatibility**: Use clients that support RESTful APIs and authentication features.

* **Understand HTTP Methods**: Familiarize yourself with standard HTTP methods (GET, POST) to interact correctly.

* **Handle Response Codes**: Implement logic for various HTTP response codes to manage errors and debug effectively.
