title: 'Use Token API'
openapi: '/api-reference/en/open-api-config/tokenization/use-token.json POST /api/v1/server-to-server-interface/payment'
description: The Card Token is used to securely complete a Purchase or Authorization transaction without needing to re-enter sensitive card details. This tokenised approach improves security and user experience. 
---

### Key Points

<Info>
  * Once a card token is generated, it can be used to execute Purchase or Authorization transactions.

  * The card token replaces the need for actual card details, ensuring that sensitive data is never exposed during the transaction.

  * This method is commonly used for:
    One-click payments,
    Recurring transactions (e.g., subscriptions),
    Stored customer payment details.

## Api Parameters

### Card Token

Use the `stored_payment_method_id` (generated during token creation) in the payload to complete the transaction.

```json Request Example
  "payment_method":{
        "type":"scheme",
        "store_payment_method":true,
        "stored_payment_method_id": "094db781-fabc-4c6d-8fcd-18bee06a527a"
    },  
```

The `stored_payment_method_id` is the token generated from the card tokenization process and is used to securely complete subsequent transactions.
