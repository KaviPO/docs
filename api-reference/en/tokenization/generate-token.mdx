### Notes

`store_payment_method`: Must be set to `true` in the payload to store the card token for future use.

```json Request Example
{
  "payment_method": {
    "type": "scheme",
    "store_payment_method": true
  }
```

Setting `store_payment_method` to `true` ensures that the card token is stored for future transactions without needing to re-enter card details.

```json Response Example
{
  "transaction_details": {
    "id": "<transaction_id>",
    "ref": <ref>,
    "timestamp": "yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.000Z",
    "merchant_txn_ref": "<string>",
    "stored_payment_method_id": "094db781-fabc-4c6d-8fcd-18bee06a527a"
  }
}
```

The `stored_payment_method_id` can be used in the Use of Card Token API for future transactions without needing to re-enter card details.
