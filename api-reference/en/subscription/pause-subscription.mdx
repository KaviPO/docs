## Key Points

<Info>
  ### Pause a Subscription

  * Merchants can use this API to pause a subscription, which stops future billing for the customer until the subscription is resumed.

  * During the paused period, the subscription remains active but will not trigger billing or provide services unless resumed.

  ### Subscription Status

  * The subscription will change to paused status in the system.

  * No billing cycles will be processed while the subscription is paused, but the merchant retains control over when to resume the subscription.

  ### Required Parameters

  * Subscription ID: The unique identifier of the subscription to be paused.
