## **Key Information Available on the Merchant Detail Page**

The Merchant Detail Page provides the following key information, each essential for proper API configuration:

### **Merchant ID**

* The **Merchant ID** is a unique identifier assigned to each merchant.

* **Required for API Payloads**: This ID must be included in API requests, as it identifies the merchant's account within the Payment Options Gateway.

* **Consistency**: Ensures transactions are attributed to the correct merchant account, facilitating accurate processing and reporting.

### **Processing Currency**

* Defines the currency in which the merchant processes transactions.

* **Currency Support**: The processing currency must align with the merchant's regional and operational requirements.

* **Examples**: JPY (Japanese Yen), USD (U.S. Dollar), PHP (Philippine Peso).

* **Configuration**: Configuring the correct currency is crucial for ensuring that customers are charged accurately, and it impacts currency conversion for international transactions.

### **Scheme Type**

* The payment schemes (e.g., **Visa**, **MasterCard**) configured for the merchant account.

* **Scheme Configuration**: Determines the types of cards accepted by the merchant, impacting the scope of customer payments.

* **Usage**: This setting should align with the merchant's target audience and preferred card networks.

## **Transaction Type**

The Merchant Detail Page also specifies transaction types that determine how payments are processed:

  <Card title="3DS (3D Secure)" icon="shield-check">
    A security protocol for online transactions that requires additional customer verification. Recommended for enhanced security, it helps prevent fraud, especially in high-risk transactions.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Non-3DS" icon="lock-open">
    Standard transactions that do not require 3DS verification. Commonly used for lower-risk transactions or where 3DS is not mandatory.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Recurring" icon="calendar">
    For scheduled, automatic transactions such as subscriptions. The API triggers these transactions based on a predefined schedule, eliminating the need for manual customer input.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Tokenized" icon="key">
    Secure transactions using a stored token instead of raw card details, allowing card-on-file payments while maintaining PCI compliance. Ideal for repeat customers or memberships.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## **Other Crucial Information**

In addition to the above key details, the Merchant Detail Page also provides other configuration information critical for the merchant's operational needs:

### **Merchant's Payment Configurations**

* Details specific payment settings that affect how transactions are processed.

* **Configuration Options**: These may include options like default settlement times, preferred authorization settings, and other merchant-specific transaction preferences.

### **Supported Payment Methods**

* **Available Payment Methods**: The page lists all supported payment methods for the merchant, such as:

  * **Apple Pay**

  * **Google Pay**

  * **GCash**

* **Multi-Channel Support**: Having multiple payment methods ensures customers can use their preferred payment channel, increasing conversion rates.

### **Limits and Restrictions**

* Defines transaction limits and processing restrictions for the merchant.

* **Transaction Limits**: The maximum amount that can be processed in a single transaction or daily limits.

* **Restrictions**: May include geographical restrictions, maximum transaction frequencies, and card type limitations, ensuring compliance with regional or operational rules.

## **Using Merchant Details for API Payload Configuration**

By accessing and correctly implementing these details, merchants and developers can build accurate and efficient API payloads. This allows for:

* **Improved Transaction Accuracy**: Ensures all transactions are routed and processed with the correct configurations.

* **Enhanced Security and Compliance**: Transaction types like 3DS and tokenization add layers of security to reduce fraud and comply with regulatory standards.

* **Customizable Customer Experience**: Supporting various payment methods and adhering to merchant-specific configurations improves the customer experience and encourages higher conversion rates.
