## Hosted Payment Page Link Creation

### Purpose
Generate a link to open the Hosted Payment Page (HPP) for capturing transactions.
### API Details
- HTTP Method: `POST`
- Endpoint URL: `/api/v1/server-to-server-interface/hpp/generate/link`


### Key Points
- If the payload is pre-filled with data (e.g., amount, currency, customer details, return_url, payment method), these details will be reflected on the HPP, providing a streamlined user experience.
- If the payload lacks certain data, the customer will need to manually enter the missing information on the HPP.
- Ensure that the necessary headers and authentication details are included to successfully generate the HPP link.
