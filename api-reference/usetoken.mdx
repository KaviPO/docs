title: 'Use of Card Token'
description: 'The Card Token is used to securely complete a Purchase or Authorization transaction without needing to re-enter sensitive card details. This tokenised approach improves security and user experience.'
---

### API Details
HTTP Method: `POST`
Endpoint URL (Purchase): `/api/v1/server-to-server-interface/payment`
Endpoint URL (Authorisation): `/api/v1/server-to-server-interface/authorization`

Key Points
<Info>
- Once a card token is generated, it can be used to execute Purchase or Authorization transactions.
- The card token replaces the need for actual card details, ensuring that sensitive data is never exposed during the transaction.
- This method is commonly used for:
One-click payments,
Recurring transactions (e.g., subscriptions),
Stored customer payment details.
</Info>

### Card Token
Use the `stored_payment_method_id` (generated during token creation) in the payload to complete the transaction.

``` json Request Example
{
  "payment_method": {
    "type": "scheme",
    "store_payment_method": "094db781-fabc-4c6d-8fcd-18bee06a527a"
  }
```
The `stored_payment_method_id` is the token generated from the card tokenization process and is used to securely complete subsequent transactions.
