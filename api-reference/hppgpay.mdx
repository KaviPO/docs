### Key Points

- These payment options will automatically appear on the HPP if the merchant is properly configured for them.

Payment Buttons
- The HPP will dynamically display Google Pay and Apple Pay buttons based on the availability and configuration of the merchantâ€™s account.
- Customers can seamlessly use either method to complete the transaction directly from the HPP.
