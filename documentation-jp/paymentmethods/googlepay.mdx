title: Google Pay
description: Google Pay allows customers to complete transactions quickly using payment methods saved to their Google Account. When enabled, our Hosted Payment Page (HPP) dynamically displays the **Google Pay** button, providing a smooth, one-click checkout experience.
---

## Overview

The **Google Pay API** enables fast, secure checkout and provides access to hundreds of millions of cards saved in Google Accounts worldwide.

Once a merchant is configured for Google Pay, the Hosted Payment Page (HPP) will automatically show the Google Pay button when the customer is using a supported device and browser (e.g., Chrome with Google Pay enabled).

---

## How It Works

When a customer clicks the **Google Pay** button on the Hosted Payment Page (HPP), the following flow occurs:

1. The **Google Pay payment sheet** opens and shows saved payment methods.
2. The customer selects a card and confirms.
3. Google Pay returns a **secure token** representing the payment details.
4. The Hosted Payment Page sends this token to our gateway for processing.
5. The transaction is completed via the configured acquirer, and The customer will be redirected to the appropriate success or failure page, as configured in your integration.

## Key Points

### Merchant Configuration

- The merchant must be **configured for Google Pay**.
- The **Google Pay Merchant ID** must be included in the Hosted Payment Page (HPP) payload.
- If the configuration is correct, the **Google Pay button** appears automatically.

### Payment Button Logic

- Google Pay will only be shown if:
  - The merchant account supports Google Pay.
  - The user is using a compatible browser (Chrome).
  - The user has Google Pay configured with eligible cards.

## Notes

- No additional development is needed if using the Hosted Payment Page — Google Pay is automatically handled and tokenized securely.
- This approach keeps you PCI-light, meaning your system avoids directly handling sensitive card data — simplifying compliance with PCI DSS requirements.
- If a customer is not eligible for Google Pay (unsupported browser or no saved cards), the button will **not appear**.
