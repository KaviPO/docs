## Order of Reference
- The PO Gateway V3 API follows the `REST`(Representational State Transfer) architectural style.
- It uses standard HTTP methods `GET`,`POST` for communication.

## Description of Payloads
- Each payload includes a description of the request and response structure.
- Details are provided on parameters, data formats, and any required authentication.


## Examples Provided
- Examples illustrate how to construct requests and interpret responses.
- While examples are shown in a few development languages, the principles apply universally to any language with HTTP client capabilities.

## Applying Examples
- The provided examples are meant to serve as a guide. Developers can adapt these examples to their preferred programming language or environment.
- Ensure that your HTTP client supports the methods and formats used in the examples.

<Note>
Use the organised reference to find detailed information on each API payload.

Adapt the provided examples to your development environment.

Ensure compatibility of your HTTP client with RESTful API principles.
