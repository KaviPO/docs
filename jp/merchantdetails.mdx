## Purpose
The Merchant Detail Page on the Gateway contains all the necessary information required to build the API payload for transactions. This includes crucial details such as the Merchant ID, Processing Currency, Scheme Type, and Transaction Type (3DS or Non-3DS).

### Key Information Available on the Merchant Detail Page
- **Merchant ID:** The unique identifier for the merchant, which must be included in API payloads.
- **Processing Currency:** The currency in which the merchant processes payments.
- **Scheme Type:** The type of payment scheme configured for the merchant (e.g., Visa, MasterCard).

### Transaction Type
- **3DS (3D Secure):** For enhanced security in online transactions.
- **Non-3DS:** For simpler, non-secured transactions.
- **Recurring:** For automated transactions that occur on a regular schedule (e.g., subscriptions).
- **Tokenized:** For transactions that use a stored token, ensuring secure card-on-file payments without handling raw card details.

### Other Crucial Information
- Merchant's payment configurations
- Supported payment methods (e.g., Apple Pay, Google Pay, GCash)
- Limits and restrictions for transaction processing
