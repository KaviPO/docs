title: ' Webhook Handler'
description: 'The Webhook Handler is used to receive and process real-time notifications (webhooks) from the API when specific events occur, such as successful payments, refunds, or failed transactions.'
---

### Webhook Events
- The API can send notifications for various events such as:
Payment Success
Payment Failure
- These events allow your system to react instantly to important changes in the transaction lifecycle.
### Endpoint URL
- You need to set up an endpoint URL that will receive `POST` requests from the API.
- This endpoint should be publicly accessible to ensure the webhooks are delivered successfully.
### Security Considerations
- It’s important to verify that the incoming requests are from the API by checking the signature or token included in the webhook.
- Use secure `HTTP` (HTTPS) to ensure that the data received is encrypted.
