## REST Architectural Style

- The PO Gateway V3 API follows the `REST`(Representational State Transfer) architectural style.
- It uses standard HTTP methods `GET`,`POST` for communication.

## Interaction with PO GATEWAY
- The API facilitates interaction between third-party software (Acquirer/Merchant Website) and PO GATEWAY through HTTP payloads.
- It uses resource-oriented URLs to structure requests and responses.

## Compatibility Features
- HTTP Authentication: Secure access to the API endpoints.
- HTTP Verbs: Utilises standard HTTP methods to perform actions (e.g., `GET` for retrieval, `POST` for creation).
- HTTP Response Codes: Provides standard response codes to indicate the status of requests (e.g., `200 OK`, `404 Not Found`).

## Base URL
- The API is accessible only via HTTPS for secure communication.
- LIVE URL: `https://api.paymentoptions.com`

<Note>
Ensure that HTTP clients are compatible with RESTful APIs.
Understand the role of HTTP methods, authentication, and response codes in interacting with the API.
