## REST Architectural Style

- The PO Gateway V3 API follows the REST (Representational State Transfer) architectural style.
- It uses standard HTTP methods `GET`,`POST` for communication.

## Interaction with PO GATEWAY:
- The API facilitates interaction between third-party software (Acquirer/Merchant Website) and PO GATEWAY through HTTP payloads.
- It uses resource-oriented URLs to structure requests and responses.

## Compatibility Features:
- HTTP Authentication: Secure access to the API endpoints.
- HTTP Verbs: Utilises standard HTTP methods to perform actions (e.g., GET for retrieval, POST for creation).
- HTTP Response Codes: Provides standard response codes to indicate the status of requests (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found).

## Base URL
- The API is accessible only via HTTPS for secure communication.
- LIVE URL: https://api.paymentoptions.com
