# Settlement Process & Processing Summary

In the world of payments, **settlement** is the final and most crucial step. It’s the process where the merchant receives the actual funds from the card transactions processed via Payment Options. This page outlines how settlements work on our platform and explains the key metrics used in your merchant settlement reports.

## Payment Options Settlement Process

Payment Options manages payment processing across multiple **acquirers** and **payment methods**, ensuring that merchants get paid efficiently and securely.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown

### 1. **Transaction Initiation**

- A customer initiates a payment on the merchant’s website or app.

- Payment Options securely routes this transaction to the appropriate acquirer based on configuration.

- The acquirer **authorizes** the transaction after validating the card and available funds.

- If the authorization is successful, the transaction is tagged as **"Authorized"**.

- Depending on the merchant’s settings:

  - **Auto Capture**: Payment Options automatically captures the amount.

  - **Manual Capture**: The merchant captures the amount after fulfilling the service or product.

- Only **captured** transactions are considered eligible for settlement.

### 2. **Settlement**

- Payment Options initiates the settlement process:

  - Reconciles incoming settlement data from the acquirer with internal transaction records.

  - Deducts the **Merchant Discount Rate (MDR)** and any applicable fees.

  - Transfers the **net amount** to the merchant’s designated bank account.

- Merchants receive a **Settlement Report** on their defined cycle:

  - **Daily**

  - **Weekly**

  - **Monthly**

### 3. **Merchant Payout**

- After reconciliation and fund transfer initiation, the final amount is credited to the merchant’s bank account.

- Settlement timelines vary but typically fall between **T\+1 to T\+3** working days, depending on acquirer and settlement agreement.
