title: Apple Pay
description: Apple Pay enables customers to quickly and securely complete purchases using cards stored in their Apple Wallet. Once Apple Pay is enabled for a merchant, our Hosted Payment Page (HPP) dynamically shows the **Apple Pay** button when accessed from a supported Apple device or browser (like Safari on macOS or iOS).
---

## Overview

Apple Pay offers a seamless and secure checkout experience using Face ID, Touch ID, or device passcode. Customers can complete payments without entering card details, helping increase conversion rates and reduce cart abandonment.

---

## How It Works

When a customer clicks the **Apple Pay** button on the HPP, the flow is as follows:

1. The **Apple Pay payment sheet** is displayed with their default or selected card.
2. The customer confirms the payment using biometrics or passcode.
3. Apple returns a **secure, encrypted token**.
4. The HPP submits the token to the PO Gateway.
5. PO processes the token via the configured acquirer and returns the result.

> Apple Pay ensures PCI compliance by handling all sensitive payment data securely on the user's device.

## Supported Devices & Browsers

Apple Pay will only be displayed on the HPP if the following conditions are met:

- The merchant is configured for Apple Pay
- The user is on a compatible Apple device:
  - iPhone, iPad, or Mac
  - Safari browser
  - Apple Wallet with an eligible card

---

## Key Points

### Merchant Configuration

- Merchant must be **enabled for Apple Pay**.
- The **Apple Pay Merchant ID** must be passed in the HPP payload.
- Once configured, the **Apple Pay button** appears automatically for eligible customers.

### Button Logic

- The HPP dynamically checks if the customer is on a supported device/browser.
- If eligible, Apple Pay is shown. Otherwise, the button is hidden.
