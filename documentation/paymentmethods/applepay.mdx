title: Apple Pay
description: Apple Pay allows customers to complete purchases quickly and securely using cards stored in their Apple Wallet. Once enabled for a merchant, our Hosted Payment Page (HPP) dynamically displays the Apple Pay button when accessed on a supported Apple device or browser (e.g., Safari on iOS/macOS).
---

## Overview

Apple Pay offers a seamless and secure checkout experience using Face ID, Touch ID, or device passcode. Customers can complete payments without entering card details, helping increase conversion rates and reduce cart abandonment.

---

## How It Works

When a customer clicks the **Apple Pay** button on the Hosted Payment Page (HPP), the flow is as follows:

1. The **Apple Pay payment sheet** is displayed with their default or selected card.
2. The customer confirms the payment using biometrics or passcode.
3. Apple returns a **secure, encrypted token**.
4. The HPP submits the token to the PO Gateway.
5. PO processes the token via the configured acquirer and returns the result.

> Apple Pay ensures PCI compliance by handling all sensitive payment data securely on the user's device.

## Supported Devices & Browsers

The Apple Pay button will only appear on the Hosted Payment Page (HPP) when all of the following conditions are met:

- The merchant is enabled for Apple Pay in their configuration.
- The customer is using a supported Apple device and browser, including:
  - iPhone, iPad, or Mac
  - Safari browser
  - Apple Wallet with at least one eligible payment card

> Note: If any of these conditions are not met, the Apple Pay button will not be displayed.

---

## Key Points

### Merchant Configuration

- Merchant must be **enabled for Apple Pay**.
- The **Merchant ID (DASMID)** must be passed in the Hosted Payment Page (HPP) payload.
- Once configured, the **Apple Pay button** appears automatically for eligible customers.

### Button Logic

- The Hosted Payment Page (HPP) dynamically checks if the customer is on a supported device/browser.
- If all conditions are met, the Apple Pay button is displayed. If not, the button remains hidden.
