title: Apple Pay
description: Apple Pay enables customers to quickly and securely complete purchases using cards stored in their Apple Wallet. Once Apple Pay is enabled for a merchant, our Hosted Payment Page (HPP) dynamically shows the **Apple Pay** button when accessed from a supported Apple device or browser (like Safari on macOS or iOS).
---

## Overview

Apple Pay offers a seamless and secure checkout experience using Face ID, Touch ID, or device passcode. Customers can complete payments without entering card details, helping increase conversion rates and reduce cart abandonment.

---

## How It Works

When a customer clicks the **Apple Pay** button on the HPP, the flow is as follows:

1. The **Apple Pay sheet** appears, allowing the user to choose a payment method and confirm with biometrics or passcode.
2. A **secure token** is generated by Apple Pay.
3. The Hosted Payment Page sends this token to the Payment Options gateway.
4. The token is processed with the configured acquirer.
5. The customer is shown a success or failure result based on the outcome.

> Apple Pay ensures PCI compliance by handling all sensitive payment data within the Apple Wallet environment.

## Supported Devices & Browsers

Apple Pay will only be displayed on the HPP if the following conditions are met:

- The merchant is configured for Apple Pay
- The user is on a compatible device:
  - iPhone, iPad, or Mac with Safari
  - Apple Wallet with supported card is set up

---

## Key Points

### Merchant Configuration

- The merchant must be **enabled for Apple Pay**.
- The **Apple Pay Merchant ID** must be passed in the HPP request payload.
- When correctly configured, the **Apple Pay button** will appear automatically.

### Button Logic

- The HPP detects user eligibility (Safari browser + supported device + Apple Pay Wallet) and conditionally renders the button.

## Notes

- Apple Pay only works on devices and browsers that support it (e.g., iPhone Safari).
- The Hosted Payment Page handles all front-end tokenization — no custom Apple JS needed.
- The button will **not appear** if the customer’s environment doesn’t meet eligibility criteria.
