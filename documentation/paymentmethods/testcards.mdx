2. **Use Test Card Details**: Replace the card details in your API requests with the test card numbers provided above. You may use any CVC value (e.g., 100).

3. **Simulate Transactions**: Use the test cards to simulate various transaction scenarios (e.g., successful payments, declined transactions) to validate your integration.

## **Additional Testing Scenarios**

* **Successful Payment**: Use any valid card number from the table above to simulate a successful transaction.

* **Declined Payment**: Use a card number specifically designated for declined payments.

* **Expired Card**: Enter an expired date (e.g., 01/20) to test how your integration handles expired cards.
