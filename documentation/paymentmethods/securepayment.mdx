## **3D Secure (3DS) Authentication**

3DS (3D Secure) authentication is a security protocol that protects merchants and customers by requiring additional verification during online payments. This process is commonly used to prevent fraud and validate the cardholder's identity.

<Card title="How 3DS Works" icon="lock">
  When a customer initiates a transaction, 3DS triggers a verification step with the card issuer. Depending on the level of risk, the customer may be required to authenticate using a password, OTP, fingerprint, or face recognition. This extra step helps confirm the identity of the cardholder, providing added security.

### **Benefits of 3DS**

* **Reduced Fraud**: 3DS helps reduce fraudulent transactions by requiring additional verification.

* **Liability Shift**: Successful 3DS authentication can shift liability for fraud-related chargebacks from the merchant to the card issuer.

* **Improved Customer Confidence**: The added security layer gives customers confidence when shopping online.

## **Data Protection and Tokenization**

**Tokenization** replaces sensitive card data with unique tokens that can only be used within our secure environment. This method ensures that customer card details are never exposed during payment processing.

### **Why Tokenization Matters**

* **Enhanced Security**: Sensitive data is replaced with a token, which reduces the risk of data theft.

* **Regulatory Compliance**: Tokenization helps merchants meet data protection regulations by securing payment information.

* **Improved User Experience**: Tokenization allows customers to save their payment information for future transactions safely.

## **Compliance with PCI DSS**

Our payment gateway complies with PCI DSS standards, which define strict security requirements for storing, processing, and transmitting payment information. Compliance with these standards ensures that our platform provides a secure environment for all transactions.
