## **Using Scheduler for Appointments**

### **Booking an Appointment**

To create an appointment:

1. **Customer Details**: Enter customer information, including name, email, and phone number.

2. **Service Selection**: Choose from available services based on customer needs.

3. **Schedule Time**: Check team availability and select a suitable time.

4. **Assign Team Member**: Choose the team member responsible for the service.

5. **Finalize Booking**: Save the appointment to confirm.

<Tip> You can add specific notes or instructions for each booking under "Booking Comment" if customers have special requests.</Tip>

### **Managing Appointments**

* **Modify**: Edit appointment details, including service, time, and assigned team member.

* **Cancel**: Remove an appointment if the customer requests cancellation or rescheduling.

* **View Details**: Access a full summary of each booking, including customer info and service specifics.

## **Payment Options for Scheduler**

**For Existing PO Merchants**:
Scheduler allows you to collect payments directly from customers by redirecting them to the payment page post-booking.

* **Send Payment Link**: Share a unique payment link with customers via email, allowing them to complete the payment online through a secure Hosted Payment Page (HPP).

* **QR Code Payment**: Display a QR code for customers preferring to pay in person. When scanned, the QR code opens the payment page on the customer’s device.

## **Best Practices for Using Scheduler**

* **Regularly Update Service Catalog**: Keep your service list updated to reflect any changes in offerings.

* **Review Availability**: Confirm that team members and services are assigned correctly to ensure accurate appointment scheduling.

* **Encourage Payment Completion**: Use payment links or QR codes to streamline the payment process, especially for upfront payments.
