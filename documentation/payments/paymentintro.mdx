## Key Participants

Before we get into the technical details, letâ€™s first understand the roles involved in every card transaction:

- **Cardholder** â€“ The customer making a purchase with their card.  
- **Merchant** â€“ The business offering goods or services.  
- **Issuer** â€“ The cardholderâ€™s bank that issued the card.  
- **Acquirer** â€“ The financial institution that enables the merchant to accept card payments.  
- **Card Scheme** â€“ Organizations like Visa, Mastercard, etc., that route and facilitate transactions.

> Card schemes license issuers and acquirers to operate on their networks. Issuers manage the cardholderâ€™s accounts, and acquirers provide services and payment acceptance to merchants.

## Technology Partners

In addition to the key participants, merchants often work with technology partners to manage the complexity of accepting card payments.

These include:

- **Payment Gateway** â€“ Securely transmits transaction data from the merchant to the acquirer.  
- **Payment Processor** â€“ Handles tasks such as transaction authorization, clearing, and settlement.  
- **Developers** â€“ Build integrations using our APIs, SDKs, or plugins to connect merchants with our services.

> Our platform often serves as both the **gateway** and **processor**, offering end-to-end support for online, in-store, and recurring payments.

## Payment Flow

Letâ€™s look at a typical payment flow when a customer makes a purchase using a card. This process includes authentication (if required), authorization, and confirmation of payment.

You can integrate this flow using our:

- **Hosted Payment Page (HPP)**  
- **Server-to-Server APIs**  
- **Mobile SDKs**  
- **Plugin-based integrations** (WooCommerce, Magento, OpenCart)

Each of these methods ensures secure transmission of card data, 3D Secure support, and real-time feedback for transaction approvals or declines.

## Settlement Flow

Once a payment is authorized, merchants need to receive their funds. This process is called settlement.

Our system supports both **automatic capture** and **manual capture** flows, depending on how you configure your transactions. Captured payments are sent in batches to the acquirer, processed by the card schemes, and the final settled amount is deposited into your account, minus applicable fees.
