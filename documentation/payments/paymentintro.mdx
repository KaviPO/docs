## Key Participants

Before we get into the technical details, let’s first understand the roles involved in every card transaction:

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="Cardholder" icon="credit-card">
    The individual who owns a payment card and uses it to make purchases online or in person. They initiate the payment process.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Merchant" icon="store">
    A business or service provider that sells goods or services and accepts payments through our gateway.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Issuer" icon="university">
    The bank or financial institution that provides the cardholder with their payment card and authorizes transactions on their behalf.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Acquirer" icon="building-columns">
    The financial institution or processor that enables merchants to accept card payments and routes transactions to the relevant card schemes.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Card Scheme" icon="network-wired">
    Global networks like Visa, Mastercard, and others that facilitate communication and transaction processing between issuers and acquirers.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>


> Card schemes license issuers and acquirers to operate on their networks. Issuers manage the cardholder’s accounts, and acquirers provide services and payment acceptance to merchants.

You'll find these terms and more in our [Glossary](/docs/get-started/glossary).

## Technology Partners

In addition to the key participants, merchants often work with technology partners to manage the complexity of accepting card payments.

These include:

- **Payment Gateway** – Securely transmits transaction data from the merchant to the acquirer.  
- **Payment Processor** – Handles tasks such as transaction authorization, clearing, and settlement.  
- **Developers** – Build integrations using our APIs, SDKs, or plugins to connect merchants with our services.

> Our platform often serves as both the **gateway** and **processor**, offering end-to-end support for online, in-store, and recurring payments.

## Payment Flow

Let’s look at a typical payment flow when a customer makes a purchase using a card. This process includes authentication (if required), authorization, and confirmation of payment.

You can integrate this flow using our:

- **Hosted Payment Page (HPP)**  
- **Server-to-Server APIs**  
- **Mobile SDKs**  
- **Plugin-based integrations** (WooCommerce, Magento, OpenCart)

Each of these methods ensures secure transmission of card data, 3D Secure support, and real-time feedback for transaction approvals or declines.

## Settlement Flow

Once a payment is authorized, merchants need to receive their funds. This process is called settlement.

Our system supports both **automatic capture** and **manual capture** flows, depending on how you configure your transactions. Captured payments are sent in batches to the acquirer, processed by the card schemes, and the final settled amount is deposited into your account, minus applicable fees.
