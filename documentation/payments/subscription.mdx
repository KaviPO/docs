Merchants can set up multiple plans with customizable billing intervals and pricing catering to various customer needs and share subscription links through channels like email or WhatsApp.

Customers can easily subscribe via a secure Hosted Payment Page (HPP) link which simplifies the process by allowing them to review plan details, enter payment information and automate future payments. This streamlined approach ensures efficient subscription management, enhances customer convenience and payment statuses, making it an ideal solution for businesses with recurring revenue models.

## **How Subscription Works**

With the Subscription product, you can create and manage multiple subscription plans, each with its own settings for recurring billing. Once a plan is created, you can send a link to your customer, allowing them to subscribe and enter their payment information.
